exercise instructions:
  1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
  2) Create variables called ActivityLabel and ActivityName that label all observations with the corresponding activity labels and names respectively
  3) Extract columns containing mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  4) From the data set in step 2, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
